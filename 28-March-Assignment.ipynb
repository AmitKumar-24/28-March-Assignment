    "## Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "This penalty term shrinks the coefficients of the regression model, reducing the impact of less important predictors and improving model performance \n",
    "         in situations where there are many predictors."

    "## Q2. What are the assumptions of Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables is linear, and that the errors are normally distributed \n",
    "         and have constant variance. Additionally, it assumes that the independent variables are not highly correlated with each other."

    "\n",
    "The value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression is typically chosen using cross-validation. The data is split into several subsets, \n",
    "         and the model is trained on each subset while being evaluated on the remaining data. The value of lambda that results in the best overall performance is chosen.\n"

    "Ridge regression can't perform feature selection, unlike Lasso regression. Ridge regression shrinks the coefficients of all variables towards zero, \n",
    "         but it doesn't set any coefficients to exactly zero. Thus, all variables contribute to the model to some extent, and Ridge regression is used when \n",

    "## Q5. How does the Ridge Regression model perform in the presence of multicollinearity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression is designed to handle multicollinearity, which is a situation where two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. \n",
    "         The Ridge regression model adds a penalty term to the loss function, which shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero. \n",

    "\n",
    "Yes, Ridge Regression can handle both categorical and continuous independent variables. In Ridge Regression, all variables are treated equally, \n",
    "         and the regularization penalty is applied to all variables regardless of their type. Therefore, the model can handle a mix of categorical and continuous variables.\n"

    "\n",
    " The coefficients of Ridge Regression represent the change in the dependent variable for each unit change in the independent variable while controlling \n",
    "         for other variables. However, unlike in linear regression, the coefficients in Ridge Regression are shrunk towards zero to reduce overfitting. \n",
